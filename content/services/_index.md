  title: Concierge Hearing Aid Services in Chicago - Boutique Hearing
  description: Boutique Hearing offers high quality hearing evaluations, customized, precise hearing aid fittings and service packages that best fits your needs.

intro: 
  heading: White Glove Service
  subhead: Boutique Hearing is revolutionizing the business of audiology. We are re-imaging not only the process of hearing aid fittings but also restructuring how they are purchased.
  copy: "A typical audiology practice will offer levels of hearing aids: entry-level, mid-level and high-end. The price you pay is based on the hearing aid you select. Seems to make sense, right? What if you knew that despite what instrument you selected you are paying for the same follow-up services. Why does this matter?


  A basic hearing aid only allows for basic adjustments. No matter how many times you go back for adjustments, the sound is going to be the same. A high-end instrument has 20+ frequencies that can be adjusted, several background noise management features and options for additional programs. What this means is the person who purchased a basic hearing aid spent money on adjustment services they will never use. 


  Boutique Hearing knows that everyone—regardless of lifestyle—will benefit from high-end instruments. Our goal is to not just bring hearing to everyone, but to bring quality hearing to everyone. Because of this, we are restructuring how hearing aid are priced."
